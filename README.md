Making a version of matchbox computer using 

an array of javaScript objects as matchboxes

In sketch2.js  I began to make boxes for all of the boxes in Gardeners article.  This would make the learning process even slower as a mistake move on the left could be made again on the right

So in sketch3. js I am not making boxes for reflections
 if in move two the computer make a bad move on the left it will not repeat that same bad move on the right.  This is a type of built in analogical thinking. that makes it more like learning by punishment for the type of move not the specific move.  The same works for reward. we are rewarding certain types of moves not just moves (a winning move on the right is like a winning move on the left)



This game originally appeared in Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column  

I first read about it in Basic Computer Games

There is a Vsause2 about it.
